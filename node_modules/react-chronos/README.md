## Documentation

### `Chronology`

The `Chronology` component is the main and only component provided by `react-chronos`. It accepts the following properties:

#### `type`

The type of chronology and timeline to render. It can one of the following values: `horizontal` or `vertical`. If not specified, the default will be `vertical`.

#### `eventSelector`

The query selector to use to find **events** inside the chronology.

#### `markerSelector`

The query selector to use to find **markers** inside the chronology.

#### `markerClassNames`

The object that defines the class names to be applied to **markers**. The shape of the object and its default values is as follow:

```js
{
    left: 'marker-left',
    right: 'marker-right',
    top: 'marker-top',
    bottom: 'marker-bottom',
}
```

For a vertical chronology the values for `left` and `right` will be applied to **markers** where its related **event** was positioned to any of those sides. The same behavior goes for horizontal chronology using `top` and `bottom`.

#### `markerStyles`

The object that defines the inline styles to be applied to **markers**. The shape of the object and its default values is as follow:

```js
{
    left: {},
    right: {},
    top: {},
    bottom: {},
}
```

For a vertical chronology the values for `left` and `right` will be applied to **markers** where its related **event** was positioned to any of those sides. The same behavior goes for horizontal chronology using `top` and `bottom`.
